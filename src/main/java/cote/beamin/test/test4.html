<div class="brinza-task-description">
    <p>You are given an implementation of a function:</p>
    <blockquote><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B); }</tt></p></blockquote>
    <p>that, given a non-empty array A of N non-negative integers and a non-empty array B of M non-negative integers, returns the minimal value that occurs in both arrays. If there is no such value, the function should return −1.</p>
    <p>For example, given arrays A and B such that:</p>
    <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">    A[0] = 1    B[0] = 4
        A[1] = 3    B[1] = 2
        A[2] = 2    B[2] = 5
        A[3] = 1    B[3] = 3
        B[4] = 2</tt>
    <p>your function should return 2, since 2 is the minimal value which occurs in both arrays A and B (another value which occurs in both arrays is 3).</p>
    <p>Given arrays A and B such that:</p>
    <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">    A[0] = 2    B[0] = 3
        A[1] = 1    B[1] = 3</tt>
    <p>your function should return −1, since there is no value that occurs in both arrays.</p>
    <p>The attached code is still <b><b>incorrect</b></b> for some inputs. Despite the error(s), the code may produce a correct answer for the example test cases. The goal of the exercise is to find and fix the bug(s) in the implementation. You can modify at most <b><b>two</b></b> lines.</p>
    <p>Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
    <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>N and M are integers within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
        <li>each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">1,000,000,000</span>].</li>
    </ul>
